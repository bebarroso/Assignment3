print("This data is the results from every world cup match in the 2022 edition. Each team has an SPI, every team has an offensive rating that represents the number of goals that it would be expected to score against an average team on a neutral field and a defensive rating that represents the number of goals that it would be expected to concede. These ratings, in turn, produce an overall SPI rating, which represents the percentage of points — a win is worth 3 points, a tie worth 1 point, and a loss worth 0 points — the team would be expected to take if that match were played over and over again.")

```{r import data, include=FALSE}

wcdata <- read.csv("https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-api/international/2022/wc_matches.csv")

#the data is available on a CSV file in github so this formula just creates a db as it reads the csv.
#there are no missing lines or values so its a very straight forward import.

The data has `r nrow(wcdata)` rows and `r ncol(wcdata)` columns. Only `r ncol(filtered)` columns will be used in the analysis, with all rows.

variable_descriptions = data.frame(Variables, Descriptions)
